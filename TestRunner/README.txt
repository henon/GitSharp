Testrunner allows contributors to easily execute the unit tests from within Visual Studio and is 
comfortable for debugging broken tests. For instance, exception backtraces are formatted such 
that Visual Studio can jump to the location in source on double click on a backtrace line in the 
output window. To print the exception backtrace of a specific failed test to the output window 
click on it in tree view.

NOTE: To run the tests set the project GitSharp.TestRunner as the startup project and run it.
